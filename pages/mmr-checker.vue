            <h2>What is LoL MMR?</h2>
            <p class="fs-5">
              MMR is the ranking system based on how good you are as a player
              based on you and other players. By having a MMR system in place,
              you can play against people at the same skill bracket (mostly
              then). MMR systems are pretty popular and is used in a wide
              verierty of things, like chess or age of empires.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5">
              In League Of Legends, MMR is calculated to see what rank you are
              and how much League Points you earn each game. The lower the
              League Points the lower the MMR is based on other people at the
              same rank.
            </p>
            <p class="fs-5">
              By Checking your MMR you may realise some critical information
              about your account. Maybe your account is pretty stuck or maybe it
              only looks like it. You can always

              to get a higher MMR faster. Because Fresh accounts have Fresh MMR.
